# Simple2DChart
Simple2DChart Library

This is a simple library to Render 2D charts
The library supports multiple axes and multiple line graphs (will add more as time permits)
The difference from other libraries is that this one is really light you will have to tell the chart library when, where and how to draw the chart there are very few auto features.
If what you need is an image the GraphRenderer has a save method that can be used to save the chart into an image
